# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Here I have done EDA of 3 different datasets; 
1 - Exploratory Data Analysis of Terrorism Activities across the globe. This project was a part of my Data Sciennce and Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation.
2 - Exploratory Data Analysis of a Retail Store. This project was also a part of my Data Sciennce and Business Analytics Internship at The Sparks Foundation.
3 - A simple Exploratory Data Analysis of semi-cleaned Titanic dataset for learning purpose.
